# LendBloc: Beginner-Friendly Crypto Lending Platform (Bun + Hono)

This project will be developed with the following best practices in mind:

*   **Code Quality:** The codebase will be type-safe, modular, and adhere to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle to ensure maintainability and reduce redundancy.
*   **Git Workflow:** After each file is modified, it should be committed with a clear and descriptive message. The agent will read the file and provide a commit message for the user to approve.

The backend will be structured as a set of modular routes using Hono. This approach promotes modularity and allows for independent development and scaling of each feature.

*   **`auth` module:** Handles user registration, login, and account recovery.
*   **`users` module:** Manages user profiles, KYC data, and preferences.
*   **`wallets` module:** Core logic for creating and managing user wallets, handling deposits, and withdrawals.
*   **`lending` module:** Implements all logic related to creating, managing, and repaying loans.
*   **`savings` module:** Manages user savings accounts, interest accrual, and distributions.
*   **`exchange` module:** Handles crypto-to-crypto swaps and coin voting.
*   **`notifications` module:** Manages sending emails and SMS messages to users.
*   **`admin` module:** Provides the API for the admin panel to manage the platform.
