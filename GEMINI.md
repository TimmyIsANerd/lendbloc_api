# LendBloc: Beginner-Friendly Crypto Lending Platform (Bun + Hono)

## Development Practices

## Project Status & Feature Checklist

All features have been implemented.

This project will be developed with the following best practices in mind:

*   **Code Quality:** The codebase will be type-safe, modular, and adhere to the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle to ensure maintainability and reduce redundancy.
*   **Git Workflow:** After each task is completed, **you (the user)** should commit the changes with a clear and descriptive message per file. This practice will ensure that all changes are tracked in version control, making it easy to revert or fix issues if they arise. The agent will indicate which files should be committed and with what message.

The backend will be structured as a set of modular routes using Hono. This approach promotes modularity and allows for independent development and scaling of each feature.

*   **`auth` module:** Handles user registration, login, and account recovery.
*   **`users` module:** Manages user profiles, KYC data, and preferences.
*   **`wallets` module:** Core logic for creating and managing user wallets, handling deposits, and withdrawals.
*   **`lending` module:** Implements all logic related to creating, managing, and repaying loans.
*   **`savings` module:** Manages user savings accounts, interest accrual, and distributions.
*   **`exchange` module:** Handles crypto-to-crypto swaps and coin voting.
*   **`notifications` module:** Manages sending emails and SMS messages to users.
*   **`admin` module:** Provides the API for the admin panel to manage the platform.
