# LendBloc API

LendBloc is a beginner-friendly crypto lending platform that empowers users to put their digital assets to work. Instead of letting crypto sit idle in a wallet, users can securely lend their assets and earn interestâ€”opening up new income opportunities without complex DeFi tools.

This project is the backend API for the LendBloc platform, developed using a modular architecture powered by Bun and the Hono framework, ensuring high performance, type safety, and a clear separation of concerns.
